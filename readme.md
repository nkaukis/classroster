## Class Roster

This is the pinned class roster (doubling as the first in-class assignment).

## Due dates:
> Steps 1 and 2 by noon on 1/09. (This is RR1: worth 5 points).
> Step 3 by midnight on 1/10 (we will work on it in class).

1. Create an account on http://www.github.com/
    + Choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information (real name, upload a photo)
    + This is public. Anyone who searches for you can see it.
    
2. Accept my Slack invitation to the course and send me and the TA (Ethan) a message. It must say (at least) your Github username.
    + Again, choose your username carefully.
    + Fill in your profile information
    + This is not public. Only those in the class can see it.
    + I have to add you to our class before you can proceed. Keep this in mind, and don't leave this until the last minute.
    
3. Use Rstudio on your machine (do not edit it on the website, I can tell the difference) to fill in your name, github username, slack username, and IU ID (your email handle, not the 10 digit number) in the table below. See my example. (This is IC1: worth 5 points).

|     Full Name           | Github username | Slack username | IU ID |
